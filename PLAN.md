- [x] [GN-45] Restore CI-safe layout regression coverage (`tests/ui.styles.regression.puppeteer.test.js`, `tests/helpers/`)
    - Audited the prior failure transcript to lock the expectations for top-editor stickiness, grid column widths, and button styling.
    - Rebuilt `tests/ui.styles.regression.puppeteer.test.js` around `createSharedPage`, including lightweight utilities to capture computed styles without launching a standalone browser.
    - Tuned the assertions to compare resolved pixel values with tolerant ranges, keeping the suite resilient while guarding the same layout guarantees.
    - Verified with a focused run and the full `npm test` sweep.
