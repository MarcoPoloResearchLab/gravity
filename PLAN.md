- [x] tests/editor.inline.puppeteer.test.js — Strengthen fallback inline editor coverage so GN-32’s mid-word ordered-list split reproduces reliably and verifies caret/text outcomes.
- [x] js/ui/markdownEditorHost.js — Refine fallback Enter handling to preserve trailing text, insert blank bullets when appropriate, and renumber ordered items correctly for GN-32.
- [ ] tests/persistence.backend.puppeteer.test.js — Replace unsupported timeout hooks with explicit abort controllers and deterministic cleanup to unblock GN-33 backend sync coverage.
- [ ] tests/helpers/puppeteerEnvironment.js — Reuse sandbox directories where safe and collapse redundant filesystem churn to lower Puppeteer startup cost (GN-33).
- [ ] tests/run-tests.js — Add per-file test runner with 30 s watchdogs and fallback kill signals, updating package.json so GN-33 enforces execution caps.
