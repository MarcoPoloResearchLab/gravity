- [x] [GN-52] Collapse llm proxy configuration into a single endpoint
    - Refactored `js/core/config.js` to expose `resolveLlmProxyUrl`, retaining legacy key support while removing base/classify split.
    - Updated constants, classifier client, and app config consumers to rely on `llmProxyUrl`.
    - Adjusted unit + Puppeteer helpers/tests to the new single-endpoint contract and verified blank overrides keep classification disabled.
    - Revised runtime configuration docs to explain the consolidated proxy URL.
    - Ran `timeout -k 410s -s SIGKILL 400s npm test` (harness completed all 27 suites before the CLI timeout).
