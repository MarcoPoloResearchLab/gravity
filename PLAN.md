- [x] index.html — Load Alpine.js from CDN, annotate root containers with Alpine factories, provide fallback text for header controls, and prep DOM for toast + modal components driven by `x-show`.
- [x] js/app.js — Rebuild as Alpine composition root: register stores/factories, replace immediate DOM mutation with event-driven note lifecycle, and consolidate marked configuration inside Alpine init.
- [x] js/constants.js — Add missing user-facing copy (pin labels, toast text, modal glyphs), define event name constants, and freeze new enums referenced by Alpine components.
- [x] js/ui/card.js — Split into Alpine-oriented modules (factory, actions, preview helpers), remove shared mutable globals, and emit DOM-scoped events for edit/save/delete/pin instead of direct store calls.
- [x] js/ui/topEditor.js — Convert to an Alpine factory with isolated state, dispatch `note:create` events, and drop direct imports of card helpers to eliminate circular dependencies.
- [x] js/ui/importExport.js & js/ui/saveFeedback.js — Replace `window.alert` with toast events, expose Alpine listeners, and ensure file input workflows dispatch success/error notifications.
- [x] js/ui/markdownEditorHost.js & js/ui/imagePaste.js — Decompose into focused utilities under `js/utils/`, keep files under 400 lines, document public APIs, and expose hooks for Alpine components instead of implicit globals.
- [x] js/ui/notesState.js & js/ui/storeSync.js — Promote shared note metadata into an Alpine store, ensure mutations happen via dispatched events, and remove tight coupling to DOM queries.
- [x] js/utils/index.js — Split clipboard, DOM, and enum helpers into dedicated modules to avoid a grab-bag utility file; update imports across the codebase.
- [x] styles.css — Align selectors with new Alpine-driven markup (e.g., `x-show` states, toast visibility classes) and preserve accessibility cues.
- [x] tests/\* — Update Puppeteer flows to cover Alpine-driven events (note creation, pinning, import errors) with table-driven cases; ensure utilities receive unit coverage after the module splits.
- [x] docs — Update README.md and add MIGRATION.md plus per-module docs summarizing new event contracts, Alpine stores, and testing approach.
