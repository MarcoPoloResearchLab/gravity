- [x] [GN-48] Re-clicking editing cards toggles view (`tests/editor.inline.puppeteer.test.js`, `js/ui/card.js`)
    - Added Puppeteer coverage that re-clicks an editing card and records mode/class transitions to detect unwanted flicker.
    - Hardened blur handling to keep cards in edit mode when the interaction originated inside the card footprint and refocused the editor without triggering finalize.
    - Re-ran the inline editor suite and the full test harness to confirm the contract and ensure no regressions across preview behaviors.
- [x] [GN-49] Shift+Enter submission flicker (`tests/editor.inline.puppeteer.test.js`, `js/ui/card.js`)
    - Add reusable test helpers that track mode transitions and editing class flips so Shift+Enter coverage can fail when the card bounces back into edit mode.
    - Expand the Shift+Enter puppeteer test to assert a single transition to view mode, no editing-class reattachment, and preview stability.
    - Adjust `finalizeCard` to keep the card in view mode for keyboard submissions by preventing deferred focus or mode resets from re-entering edit.
    - Validate with `npm test -- tests/editor.inline.puppeteer.test.js` and the full harness.
