- [x] [GN-50] Environment-specific endpoint configuration
    - Added environment mapping and detection to `js/core/config.js`, returning production or development defaults when specified.
    - Expanded `tests/config.runtime.test.js` to cover environment-driven resolutions and normalization behavior.
    - Documented configuration flows and the new `<meta name="gravity-environment">` option in `README.md`.
    - Verified the change set with `timeout -k 400s -s SIGKILL 400s npm test`.
