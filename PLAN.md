- [x] [GN-48] Re-clicking editing cards toggles view (`tests/editor.inline.puppeteer.test.js`, `js/ui/card.js`)
    - Added Puppeteer coverage that re-clicks an editing card and records mode/class transitions to detect unwanted flicker.
    - Hardened blur handling to keep cards in edit mode when the interaction originated inside the card footprint and refocused the editor without triggering finalize.
    - Re-ran the inline editor suite and the full test harness to confirm the contract and ensure no regressions across preview behaviors.
- [ ] [GN-49] Shift+Enter submission flicker (`tests/editor.inline.puppeteer.test.js`, `js/ui/card.js`)
    - Extend Shift+Enter coverage to assert the card stays stable after submission and returns to preview only once edits are committed.
    - Align finalize flow to avoid transient view toggles or misplaced focus during keyboard submissions.
