- [x] [GN-51] Inline editor blur regression causes action buttons to be unusable
    - Confirmed regression via pointer tracking and crafted a Puppeteer test that verifies pinning while editing finalizes the card.
    - Scoped blur suppression to editor surfaces and finalized editing on non-copy card actions to keep buttons accessible.
    - Executed the targeted suite followed by `timeout -k 400s -s SIGKILL 400s npm test` to validate the fix.
