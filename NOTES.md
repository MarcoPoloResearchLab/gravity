# Notes

## Rules of engagement

Review the NOTES.md. Make a plan for autonomously fixing every item under Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance. Ensure no regressions. Ensure adding tests. Lean into integration tests. Fix every issue. Document the changes.

Fix issues one by one. Write a nice comprehensive commit message AFTER EACH issue is fixed and tested and covered with tests. Do not work on all issues at all. Work at one issue at a time sequntially. 

Remove an issue from the NOTES.md after the issue is fixed (new tests are passing). Commit the changes and push to the remote.

Leave Features, BugFixes, Improvements, Maintenance sections empty when all fixes are implemented but don't delete the sections themselves.

## Features

## Improvements

- [ ] [GN-08] Add delete line shortcut. Check if it doesnt exist already in MDE. Document the shortcut
- [ ] [GN-09] Add duplicate line where the cursor is shortcut. Check if it doesnt exist already in MDE. Document the shortcut

## BugFixes

- [ ] [GN-07] I have deleted the top line of the numbered list and then pressed CMD-Enter. The list hasn't been renumbered after that. leaving the note using down cursor also didnt re-numbered the list. Ensure that the lists stay properly numbered with accurate handling of the nested lists
