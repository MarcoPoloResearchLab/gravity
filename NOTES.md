# Notes

## Rules of engagement

Review the notes.md. make a plan for autonomously fixing every bug. ensure no regressions. ensure adding tests. lean into integration tests. fix every bug.

Fix bugs one by one. Write a nice comprehensive commit message AFTER EACH bug is fixed and tested and covered with tests. Remove the bug from the notes.md. commit and push to the remote.
