# Gravity Notes

Gravity Notes is a single-page Markdown notebook designed to keep you in flow. Every idea lives in the same grid, edits happen inline, and the interface never yanks you out of context.

## Highlights

- Inline Markdown editing with a stable layout—no modals or page reloads.
- Bounded HTML previews with fade masks and quick expand controls for longer notes.
- Checklist toggles, code badges, and cover images that surface context automatically.
- Works offline by default and syncs seamlessly when you sign in with Google.
- Full-screen focus mode, expressive keyboard shortcuts, and native spellcheck/grammar support.
- Automatic release detection reloads the app when a new build becomes available.

## Quick Start

1. Open Gravity Notes in your browser (hosted deployment or local build).
2. Capture a new idea in the blank card anchored beneath the header.
3. Click elsewhere or press `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` to save—Gravity autosaves on blur, so no manual save button is required.
4. Click any rendered card to edit Markdown inline; the caret jumps to the spot you clicked.
5. Use the controls along the right edge to pin, copy, merge, or delete notes without leaving the grid.

## Everyday Workflow

- **Scan effortlessly:** Cards reveal the first paragraphs, the first image, and a code badge when snippets are present. Overflowing notes expose a circular arrow button to expand and collapse without disrupting the grid.
- **Keep lists moving:** Click checklist boxes directly in the rendered view to toggle them. Updates save immediately and bubble the refreshed note to the top.
- **Stay focused:** Toggle the diagonal icon in the header to switch between the regular layout and full-screen workspace.
- **Anchor your context:** Cards never jump during edits, so neighbouring notes remain where you left them.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Enter` — insert a newline inside the editor.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` or `Cmd/Ctrl+S` — commit the current note.
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` — indent or outdent lists and code blocks.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+K` — delete the current line.
- `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+D` — duplicate the current line.

## Importing & Sharing

- Open the avatar menu to export your notebook as JSON or import a snapshot. Gravity skips duplicates automatically.
- Use the copy control on each card to grab either Markdown or sanitised HTML for quick sharing.

## Accounts, Sync, and Offline Use

- Sign in with Google from the header to scope the notebook to your account. Each user gets a private storage namespace, so shared devices never mix data.
- Gravity keeps working offline. Notes persist in `localStorage` and sync when connectivity returns or when you sign in.
- Sessions survive refreshes. Sign out from the avatar menu to return to the anonymous notebook.

## Markdown Tips

- Paste or drag images directly into the editor—Gravity inserts attachment placeholders that render in the preview.
- Code blocks receive a `code` badge so technical notes stand out at a glance.
- The EasyMDE editor keeps native spellcheck and grammar suggestions active alongside Markdown tooling.
